Finally, we thought of a hybrid approach, to suppport our quantum device with a classical computer, such that a part of the quantum complexity would be transformed in some classical complexity. Indeed, in the NISQ area we can't rely on arbitrarily big quantum computers: the number of avalaible qubits is in reality resticted to some upper value. Considering an arbitrarily big $N$-node graph, we would thus like to find a way to divide our problem into smaller problems that could be solved by our NISQ computer.

Every of these subproblems requires $(N'-2)(N'-3)$ qubits, with $N'=N-1$. Supposing that we have solved this subproblems and obtains the respective optimal costs $C_i$ and optimal paths $S_i = [i,..., N-1]$, we deduce the global optimal cost as being $\\max\\{C_i + w_{0,i} \\text{ for } i \\in\\{1,...,N-2\\}\\}$, reached for $i=i_0$.
